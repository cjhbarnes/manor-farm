        <h2>The Farm Shop</h2>
        <p>The Farm Shop has been open since 2002 starting life as one of the smaller farm buildings in the Farm Courtyard.</p>
        <p>We are an outlet for fully traceable meat, mainly reared here on the farm. Our own Angus &amp; Hereford Beef, Lamb and Gloucestershire Old Spots and Large White Pork, plus local free range Chicken, and a good variety of seasonal game such as Venison, Duck, Pheasant, Partridge, Guinea Fowl and Rabbit.</p>
        <p>Add to this a great selection of our own recipe sausages, made on the premises, and choices of hams and bacon, alongside local free range eggs, and our own organic eggs from the Farm itself. Our chilled cabinets are well stocked with our home produced milk, and the delicatessen is home to a large range of British and continental cheeses, some of which are local, plus fabulous olives and continental cured meats.</p>
        <p>The Produce section is extensive and varied, providing a selection of tasty and colourful Fruit and vegetables sourced as locally as possible everything you need, and to go with it all you will find drinks, preserves, chocolates and sweets. Our freezers offer a large selection of frozen fruit &amp; vegetables, pastries and ice cream. Hampers are available to provide that wonderful gift when you need it! The Gift section offers Emma Bridgewater China, Cards, pictures, household ornaments and many unusual and individual gifts at reasonable prices.</p>
